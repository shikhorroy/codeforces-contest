> ### [[GFG] 0 - 1 Knapsack Problem](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/0-1-knapsack-problem0945/1)

**Short Description:**

You are given weights and values of **N** items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity **W** to get the <u>maximum
total value</u> in the knapsack.
<br>Note that we have only one quantity of each item.

Example 1:

    Input:
    N = 3
    W = 4
    values[] = {1,2,3}
    weight[] = {4,5,1}
    Output: 3

Example 2:

    Input:
    N = 3
    W = 3
    values[] = {1,2,3}
    weight[] = {4,5,6}
    Output: 0

Constraints:

    1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
    1 ≤ W ≤ 1000
    1 ≤ wt[i] ≤ 1000
    1 ≤ v[i] ≤ 1000
