# [DP] Subset sum

> ### [[GFG] Subset Sum Problem](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/subset-sum-problem-1611555638/1)

Given an array of non-negative integers, and a value **sum**, determine if there is a subset of the given set with sum
equal to given sum.

Example 1:

    Input:
    N = 6
    arr[] = {3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2}
    sum = 9
    Output: 1
    Explanation: Here there exists a subset with
    sum = 9, 4 + 3 + 2 = 9.

Example 2:

    Input:
    N = 6
    arr[] = {3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2}
    sum = 30
    Output: 0
    Explanation: There is no subset with sum 30.

Constraints

    1 <= N <= 100
    1<= arr[i] <= 100
    1<= sum <= 10^5
